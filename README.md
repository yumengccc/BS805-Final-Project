# Relationship between Plasma Homocysteine and Cognitive Status

In cross-sectional studies, elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been associated with poor cognition and dementia. A prospective study used data from the Framingham Study to show that increased plasma homocysteine is an independent risk factor for the development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (NEJM 2002). We will use a subset of the data used in that study to perform various analyses.  

(1) Combine the three data sets  
(2) Create new variables  
(3) Compare those were excluded to those were not excluded  
(4) Create a new data set excluding those with missing values  
(5) Vertical bar charts and Descriptive statistics  
(6) Both homocysteine and cognitive function may change with age  
    6.1 Test if LHCY (dependent) linearly associated with continuous age  
    6.2 Test if MMSE (dependent) linearly associated with continuous age  
(7) Test if mean LHCY are the same in the four age groups  
(8) Piecewise linear model of log homocysteine and age  
(9) A multiple linear regression with interaction with a dummy variable for gender  
(10) A linear regression model with MMSE and LHCY  
(11) A full multiple linear regression model and Regression diagnostics  
    11.1 Full multiple linear regression analysis  
    11.2 Regression diagnostics  
(12) Model selection using LASSO with an AIC-based selection criterion
